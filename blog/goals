CURRENT
working on edit button for user owned posts
want to make the form a modal 
think i may need to look into bsmodalform 
django-bootstrap-modal-forms 2.2.0
in order to do this without needing to create a separate view





make profile image editable on click
settings views
make followers/following numbers that lead to view for each
  include follower/following search
  list all follower/following depending on choice
add image posts
add profile image to posts
